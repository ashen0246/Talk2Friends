Hello and welcome to Talk2Friends!

To run this app, we used a Pixel 2 API 24 Nougat 7.0. Android Studio Chipmunk. 

To begin testing of Talk2Friends, please run the application on an emulator with the settings above.
The opening page defaults to login. If you'd like to use an existing account, please type in the email "alshen@usc.edu" and the password "123123" and click continue at the bottom of the page.
If you'd like to create your own account instead, click the "switch to sign up" button in the middle of the screen. Enter your USC email and an account password, then click continue.
You will receive an email from Firebase, click the link inside it to verify your USC email. Return to the app and enter your name, birthday, affiliation, and proficiency. The latter two use toggle buttons, if you want to change from student to alumni simply click student and it will change.
Enter your interests below by clicking whichever ones you're interested in. Click continue and finally you're signed in!

The main page is the meetings page. This lists all meetings that have been currently created, and you can scroll down if there are many meetings happening soon. You can click join to join meetings, and leave to leave meetings you're currently in.
Click create on the top right to make a new meeting. Fill out the info and hit create again to make one!

Using the buttons on the bottom of the screen, navigate to the profile page. There, you can edit any of the info you put in when making your account. If you want to change your name, type in a new name and hit edit. If you navigate back to the profile page, you'll see that the new name will appear! 

** SPRINT ADDITION: On the bottom half of the profile page, you can find the contact support zone! Since this app is still in development, if you have any issues please type them in the box and click send to notify us so we can fix the bugs as fast as possible. **

Finally, you can navigate to the friends page. Here all your current friends will be displayed near the top, allowing you to remove them if you want.
Next is your friend requests, which you can accept or deny.
After that are your recommended friends. These are other users that share at least two interests in common with you! If you want to become friends with them, send them a request using the button.
At the bottom there is a invite friends option. Type in your friend's USC email and click invite, select the GMAIL app from the android selection menu, and then send the email to invite a friend to join the app! Please note that a valid email app on your emulator is needed for this to work.

If the project doesn't build properly when running initially, clean and rebuild the project and it should work. If your emulator is frozen, go to device manager and wipe the device data to restart it.
Thank you for checking out Talk2Friends!
